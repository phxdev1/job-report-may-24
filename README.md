# April - May '24 GlassDoor Job Report By Mark Scott

## Hello! ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹
I've prepared this report based on AI analysis of hundreds of job posts in the ServiceNow ecosystem from GlassDoor. All the data I've used is available in this repository in the "/dataset" folder. The graphs and presentation was generated using only this data and may be reproduced at will. I only ask that you site me as a source if you use the data or my facts as your own. 

The "Full" dataset is just the Administrator file and the Developer file added together and deduplicated. You will find the Python code used to generate the graphs in the "script" subfolder.

If you have comments, questions or concerns, please [reach out to me on LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/phxdev/)!
